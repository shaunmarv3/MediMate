## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Container (Recommended)

```javascript
import HealthInsightsContainer from '@/components/HealthInsightsContainer';

function Dashboard() {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <HealthInsightsContainer userId={user.uid} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**What it does:**
1. Fetches 30-day health data
2. Generates AI insights via Gemini
3. Displays in gradient cards
4. Includes refresh button

---

### Option 2: Direct Component

```javascript
import HealthInsights from '@/components/HealthInsights';

function MyComponent() {
  const insights = [
    {
      type: 'positive',
      category: 'blood_pressure',
      message: 'Your blood pressure has improved by 5% this week!',
      priority: 1
    },
    {
      type: 'achievement',
      category: 'adherence',
      message: '🎉 Perfect medication adherence for 7 days!',
      priority: 1
    }
  ];
  
  return <HealthInsights insights={insights} loading={false} />;
}
```

// Inside Dashboard component:
<HealthInsightsContainer userId={user.uid} />
```

**Location:** Displays below health stats, above charts

---

## 🧪 Testing States

## 🎤 Talking Points for Mentors

> "I've built a **HealthInsights component** that displays AI-generated health insights in beautiful gradient cards. The component accepts insights as props, making it reusable and testable.
>
> I've implemented **5 unique gradient types** using Tailwind CSS - each representing a different insight category: positive (green), alert (red), neutral (gray), achievement (purple-pink), and improvement (blue).
>
> The animations use **Framer Motion** with staggered timing - each card slides in from the left with a fade-in effect, delayed by 0.1 seconds for a cascade effect. I've also added hover scale effects and spring physics for natural movement.
>
> The component includes a **loading skeleton** with pulse animations while data is fetching, and gracefully handles empty states.
>
> I've wrapped everything in a card with the title '🧠 AI Health Insights' and created a separate container component that handles data fetching, so the main component stays pure and focused on presentation."
