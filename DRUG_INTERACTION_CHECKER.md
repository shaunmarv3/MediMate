## 🎯 How It Works

### Automatic Check Flow:
```
User fills medication form → Clicks "Add Medication"
    ↓
AI checks against existing medications (2-3 seconds)
    ↓

## 🎨 User Experience

### 1. **Safety Banner** (When you have existing medications)
```
🛡️ Drug Interaction Check Enabled

Our AI will automatically check for dangerous interactions 
with your 3 existing medications before adding this one.

[Lisinopril] [Aspirin] [Metformin]
```

### 2. **Loading State**
```
🔍 Checking for drug interactions...
```

### 3. **Results**

#### ✅ **No Interaction:**
```
✅ No interactions detected. Safe to add!
[Medication added normally]
```

#### ⚠️ **Moderate/Minor Interaction:**
Beautiful modal with:
- **Yellow/Blue Header**: Severity indicator
- **Explanation**: What the interaction is
- **Specific Risks**: Bullet list of potential issues
- **Safer Alternatives**: AI-suggested medications
- **Recommendation**: Doctor consultation advice
- **Two Buttons**:
  - Cancel - Don't Add
  - Proceed with Caution

#### 🚨 **Critical Interaction:**

## 💡 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Warfarin + Aspirin
```json
{
  "severity": "Critical",
  "hasInteraction": true,
  "explanation": "Both Warfarin and Aspirin thin the blood. Combined use significantly increases bleeding risk, including internal bleeding, stroke, and hemorrhage.",
  "specificRisks": [
    "Severe bleeding (gastrointestinal, intracranial)",
    "Increased risk of stroke",
    "Prolonged bleeding from minor cuts",
    "Bruising and hemorrhage"
  ],
  "alternativeSuggestions": [
    "Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain relief",
    "Discuss NSAID alternatives with your doctor"
  ],
  "recommendation": "DO NOT combine these medications. Consult your doctor immediately before taking together."
}
```

### Example 2: Lisinopril + Potassium Supplement
```json
{
  "severity": "Moderate",
  "hasInteraction": true,
  "explanation": "Lisinopril (ACE inhibitor) raises potassium levels. Adding potassium supplements can lead to hyperkalemia (dangerous high potassium).",
  "specificRisks": [
    "Hyperkalemia (high potassium)",
    "Heart rhythm problems",
    "Muscle weakness",
    "Irregular heartbeat"
  ],
  "alternativeSuggestions": [
    "Eat potassium-rich foods instead (bananas, spinach)",
    "Ask doctor about adjusting Lisinopril dose"
  ],
  "recommendation": "Requires medical supervision. Have your doctor monitor potassium levels if taking both."
}
```

### Example 3: Metformin + Ibuprofen
```json
{
  "severity": "Minor",
  "hasInteraction": true,
  "explanation": "NSAIDs like Ibuprofen can reduce kidney function, potentially affecting Metformin elimination and increasing lactic acidosis risk in rare cases.",
  "specificRisks": [
    "Reduced kidney function (mild)",
    "Slight increase in lactic acidosis risk",
    "Monitor kidney function if used long-term"
  ],
  "alternativeSuggestions": [
    "Acetaminophen for pain/fever",
    "Use Ibuprofen only short-term (3-5 days)"
  ],
  "recommendation": "Generally safe for short-term use. Monitor kidney function if using Ibuprofen regularly."
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### AI Prompt Strategy:
```
1. Analyze NEW medication: Name + Dosage
2. Compare against CURRENT medications list
3. Check drug-drug interaction databases
4. Classify severity (Critical/Moderate/Minor/None)
5. Provide detailed explanation
6. List specific health risks
7. Suggest safer alternatives
8. Give actionable recommendation
```

### Response Format:
```typescript
interface DrugInteraction {
  severity: 'Critical' | 'Moderate' | 'Minor' | 'None';
  hasInteraction: boolean;
  explanation: string;
  specificRisks: string[];
  alternativeSuggestions: string[];
  recommendation: string;
}
```

### Function: `checkDrugInteraction()`
```javascript
checkDrugInteraction(
  newDrug: { name: string, dosage: string },
  currentDrugs: Array<{ name: string, dosage: string }>
) => Promise<DrugInteraction | null>
```
